Vincent, I love you so much. You are a great person and I'll always have a special place in my heart for you, but I don't know how much more of this I can take.
I love you so deeply but recently it seems off. I can send you a whole paragraph how I feel and how I love you and it will always feel like you don't feel the same. I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't acknowledge my feelings and make me feel loved. No matter how much I love you and want to be there for you, I want to still feel loved and appreciated. I've also been having a real rough week and the fact you don't show the same love and affection to me hurts me more than it should. It tears me apart on the inside. I shouldn't have to ask you to treat me the same way. It feels like you only came back to me because you hate the feeling of being without a girlfriend. Again, I'll always love you but I'm not gonna be with you if you don't know how to be in a relationship. I still wanna be close friends with you. I just feel so abandoned by you. I miss what we had before. It seems like that spark is gone. I've been overthinking so fucking much because I always feel like I'm annoying you and I'm just a piece of shit to you. I always have a feeling you're talking to other girls and it's all because of the Franny situation. Everything's fucked up now. I wish I wouldn't fucking miss you so much but I just can't deal with this anymore. You were great and you're a great friend but I think you really need that break from relationships. I'll still always be here for you but I can't take one more minute of feeling like the person I love so deeply who claims to love me just as much doesn't actually care one bit for me. I feel like I'm being lied to all the time. 
I don't know if I can spend one more moment of it. If feels like we used to talk but now it's just a one sided conversation where one person just replies. I'm really sorry but I just need to take a big step back. I'll always love you. I'm sorry again but I just can't stay when I feel just as hurt now as I did when you left me. I figure everyday I said I was sad but didn't know why was because of all this. I don't really know what comes after this. Just know I'm not falling out of love, I just need a little break or something. I'm not sure if I was ready to start again. I guess I'll talk to you now if you're still up unless you want to go to bed. Then we can talk in the morning. But if you're asleep, please sleep well and have a good day. I love you. ❤️
I just need a little time to think
I'm sorry
I love you.
I know I kinda just dropped this on you and I'm sorry maybe I'm overreacting but there's just so much I need to get off my chest and I think we should talk about it because I still love you
It's not fine. I genuinely love you a lot and I can't get over my damn insecurities  about the fact I feel everythings fucked up. You know I love you a lot but I don't know if we should be together because I feel like I'm putting too much stress on you
I think it'll be better when we talk tomorrow I hope
But if we do end up talking and we break up just know it isn't your fault, I'm just being dumb and insecure and shit
I don't wanna break up with you but I feel like it would be for the best
I'm still really sorry about everything and I know saying sorry won't do anything but I just genuinely feel really bad, I never wanted to hurt you in any way
You're a great person and you deserve someone just as great




I'm cooked.
